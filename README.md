## 📖 What is AURA?

AURA is a **fully local** AI desktop assistant built in Python. It runs entirely on your own machine — no cloud APIs, no subscriptions, no data leaving your computer. You talk to it by voice or text, and it responds through a sleek dark-themed GUI.

Under the hood, AURA is a collection of specialised AI agents that collaborate: a planner breaks your request into steps, a router decides which tools to use, and individual agents execute — whether that's searching the web, writing and running code, controlling your computer, scanning a network, building an entire software project from scratch, or running a scheduled background task while you sleep.

## ✨ Features

### 🗣️ Voice & Chat Interface
- Wake-word free push-to-talk voice input using **Vosk** (offline speech recognition)
- Natural text-to-speech output via **Piper TTS** (zero latency, runs locally)
- Smart Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to auto-stop listening when you finish speaking
- Full chat GUI with message bubbles, obsidian dark theme, and real-time streaming

### 🧠 AI Reasoning
- **Deep Thinking Mode** — uses a dedicated reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1) to work through complex problems step by step
- **LRU-cached thoughts** — identical questions don't re-run the reasoning model
- Multiple Ollama model support: separate models for chat, coding, vision, thinking, and planning

### 🌐 Web Search & Research
- **Web Search** — DuckDuckGo search with top 5 results summarised in context
- **Deep Research** — multi-query research that fires 3+ searches and synthesises findings
- **Browser Automation** — Playwright-powered headless browser for real page interaction: fill forms, log in to sites, scrape dynamic content (no more fragile screenshot→click loops)
- Automatically triggered when AURA detects your question needs current information

### 🔧 Skills Plugin System *(NEW)*
- Drop a folder into `skills/` and AURA auto-loads it on next start — no config needed
- Skills run **before** the LLM is called, giving instant results for common tasks
- Ships with **Weather** (wttr.in, no API key) and **Unit Converter** built in
- Full authoring guide in `skills/HOW_TO_WRITE_A_SKILL.md` — open to community contributions
- Enable/disable individual skills at runtime from `aura_config.json`

### 📅 Proactive Scheduler *(NEW)*
- AURA can act **without you prompting it** — check emails, run research, send reminders
- Natural language scheduling: *"remind me every day at 9am"*, *"search for AI news every Monday at 8am"*, *"in 15 minutes..."*
- Jobs persist in `scheduler_jobs.json` and survive restarts
- View scheduled tasks from the GUI or via Telegram `/schedule`

### 📱 Telegram Remote Interface *(NEW)*
- Talk to AURA from your phone anywhere via **Telegram**
- Supports text messages, voice notes (auto-transcribed via Vosk), and photos (vision)
- Commands: `/skills`, `/schedule`, `/memory`, `/status`
- Locked to your Telegram user ID — no one else can access your instance
- Setup: add `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` and `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_IDS` to `.env`

### 🤖 Autonomous Agent Mode
- Give AURA a high-level goal and it **plans and executes a multi-step task chain** without hand-holding
- Supports tool chains: web search → analysis → code generation → save report
- Generates `.docx` Word reports or `.txt` files automatically
- Fallback keyword planner if the LLM planner times out

### 💻 Computer Use
- AURA can **control your computer** — move the mouse, click, type, open apps
- Screenshot → Vision AI → Action Plan → Execute loop
- Supports Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Spotify, Discord, VS Code, and more via shortcut table
- Safe: `pyautogui.FAILSAFE = True` always enabled

### 🖼️ Vision
- **Webcam vision** — grab a frame and describe what AURA sees
- **Real-time YOLO object detection** background thread (~20 FPS)
- Vision results injected into conversation context automatically
- Image results cached via LRU to avoid redundant inference

### 🎨 Image Generation
- SDXL-Turbo local image generation — fully offline
- Images saved to `generated_images/`
- GPU acceleration supported (CUDA)

### 🔐 Security Agent
- Full pentest terminal with AI guidance
- Supports nmap, gobuster, hashcat, and more
- WSL integration on Windows; native shell on Linux/macOS

### 🕵️ OSINT Agent
- Investigate usernames, emails, names across dozens of platforms
- Generates full `.docx` intelligence reports
- GitHub, Reddit, HackerNews, and more via free APIs

### 💻 VM Coding Agent (IDE Mode)
- Describe a project in plain English → AURA architects, writes, and runs it
- DeepSeek-Coder-V2 for file generation with multi-round fix loops
- Built-in code editor with syntax highlighting and live terminal

### 🎵 Music Recognition
- ACRCloud-powered music identification (listens for 8 seconds)

### 🧬 Self-Improvement
- AURA can read, critique, and rewrite its own source files
- Always backs up before modifying, validates Python syntax before overwriting

## 🧩 How the AI Pipeline Works

```
User Input (voice, text, or Telegram)
        │
        ▼
  Skills Fast-Path ──► Matches keyword? → Run skill instantly (no LLM)
        │ no match
        ▼
  Scheduler Check ──► Schedule phrase? → Create APScheduler job
        │ no match
        ▼
  Decision System ──► computer use? code? browser? web search? thinking? vision?
        │
        ▼
  Tool Execution ──► Runs selected tools (browser, search, vision, etc.)
        │
        ▼
  LLM Response ──► Builds context from memory + tool results → Ollama → response
        │
        ▼
  Memory System ──► Saves interaction with embedding for future semantic recall
        │
        ▼
  TTS + GUI Output ──► Piper speaks the response, GUI displays it
        │
        ▼
  Telegram Mirror ──► Response also sent to Telegram if message came from there
```

**Memory** uses sentence embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for semantic search — AURA doesn't just remember the last few messages, it retrieves the most *relevant* past context even from 100 conversations ago.

## 🔧 Writing a Skill

Skills are the fastest way to extend AURA. Drop a folder into `skills/` and it auto-loads:

```
skills/
└── my_skill/
    ├── skill.py     ← required
    └── SKILL.md     ← recommended
```

Minimal `skill.py`:
```python
NAME     = "My Skill"
ICON     = "🚀"
KEYWORDS = ["trigger word", "another phrase"]

def run(prompt: str, context: str = "") -> dict:
    return {"success": True, "output": "My response"}
```

See `skills/HOW_TO_WRITE_A_SKILL.md` for the full guide.

---

## 📱 Telegram Setup

1. Message `@BotFather` on Telegram → `/newbot` → copy the token
2. Get your Telegram user ID from `@userinfobot`
3. Add to `.env`:
```env
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=1234567890:ABCdef...
TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_IDS=987654321
```
4. Set `enable_telegram_bot: true` in `aura_config.json`

Available commands: `/skills`, `/schedule`, `/memory`, `/status`, `/help`

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Ollama connection error**
Make sure `ollama serve` is running. Check it's accessible at `http://localhost:11434`.

**"Vosk model not found"**
Update `VOSK_MODEL_PATH` in your `.env` to point to the extracted model folder (must contain `conf/` or `am/`).

**"Piper not found" / No voice output**
- Windows: Update `PIPER_PATH` and `PIPER_MODEL` in `.env`
- Linux: Run `bash setup_unix.sh` — it downloads and configures Piper automatically
- macOS: `brew install espeak` as a fallback, or use `setup_unix.sh`

**Playwright not working**
```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install chromium
```

**APScheduler not found**
```bash
pip install apscheduler
```

**Telegram bot not responding**
- Check `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` is set in `.env`
- Check `enable_telegram_bot: true` in `aura_config.json`
- Ensure your user ID is in `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_IDS`

**Image generation is very slow**
SDXL-Turbo on CPU takes 20-60 seconds on first run. A GPU (CUDA) will make this 10x faster — set `torch_dtype=torch.float16` and `pipe.to("cuda")` in `image_gen.py`.

**Security Agent shows "virtual shell"**
WSL is not installed. Run `wsl --install` (Admin terminal, requires restart). Basic network commands still work via AURA's built-in Python emulator without WSL.

**`webrtcvad` install fails on Windows**
```bash
pip install webrtcvad-wheels
```

**`pyaudio` install fails on Windows**
```bash
pip install pipwin
pipwin install pyaudio
```

**`pyaudio` install fails on Linux**
```bash
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev
pip install pyaudio
```

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **100% local** — AURA never sends your conversations, voice data, or files to any external server
- All AI inference runs through your local Ollama instance
- Web search uses DuckDuckGo (no tracking)

- Telegram bot is locked to your user ID — set `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_IDS` in `.env`
- The Security Agent requires explicit permission before installing any tool
- `self_improvement.py` always backs up files before modifying and validates syntax before overwriting
